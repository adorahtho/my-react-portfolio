        Hello, my name is Adorah Tho. I am a mom of two and currently work as a Prior Authorization Clerical Analyst. In my position I work through different queues reviewing prior authorizations for different types of services. Once in awhile I will hear about the system side and see things get updated or changed. That was when I first started getting curious about coding so I decided to dabble in a little HTML and CSS on Codecamy. The things I learned like creating a paragraph, a list, or simply adding a submit button made me feel excited because those were little things I see being used everyday. It  made me realize all the posibilities out there with coding and gives me the desire to learn more.
